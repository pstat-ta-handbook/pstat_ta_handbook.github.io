# Feedback From Instructors

The instructor of each course is able to give feedback both to the Teaching Assistants and to the department regarding performance of the Teaching Assistant duties. 

Beginning in Fall 2023, instructors will be able to upload their TA feedback, sharing it with the DGS (@sec-StaffandFacultyContact). Instructors are encouraged to share this feedback with their TA's as well so that the TA can find areas of improvement. While it is best practice to maintain ongoing communication and feedback throughout the quarter between instructors and TA's (see @sec-InstructorConflicts), it can be helpful to evaluate how the entire quarter went.

The DGS may use this information to inform assignments in future quarters or to find good candidates for Head TA or Teaching Associate opportunities.

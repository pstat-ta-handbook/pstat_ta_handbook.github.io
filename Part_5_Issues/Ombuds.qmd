# Office of the Ombuds

If you encounter a situation with a student that cannot be resolved, you should first look to the course instructor for guidance. There are many resource people in the department such as the [TA Training Coordinators](#AcadLead)

consult the instructor or the TA Training Coordinators for guidance.

It may happen that the Instructor or the TA Training Coordinators will suggest reaching out to the university [Office of the Ombuds](ombuds.ucsb.edu/students/services). This office provides consultation and mediation services for faculty and students.

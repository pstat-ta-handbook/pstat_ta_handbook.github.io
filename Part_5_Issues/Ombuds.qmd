# Office of the Ombuds

If you encounter a situation with a student that cannot be resolved, you should first look to the course instructor for guidance. There are also  resource people in the department such as the [TA Training Coordinators](#AcadLead) who can help you navigate thorny issues. 

It may happen that the Instructor or the TA Training Coordinators will suggest reaching out to the university [Office of the Ombuds](http://ombuds.ucsb.edu/students/services). This office provides consultation and mediation services for faculty and students. They can be a valuable resource in finding equitable solutions to intractable problems.

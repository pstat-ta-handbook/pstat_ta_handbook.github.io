# Keeping Students Engaged in Section

Fostering active student engagement in section is vital for effective learning.  Before the course commences, it is crucial to clarify the instructor’s expectations for the sections.  Depending on the course, some may follow a highly structured approach, providing a designated timeline and activities for each section, while others may grant more autonomy to the TA.  Regardless of the level of flexibility, there are various strategies that can be effectively utilized to enhance student engagement.

While numerous engagement strategies are available, we will focus on a few of our favorites.  To begin your first section on a positive note, employ fun and interactive icebreaker activities that foster a welcoming and collaborative learning environment.  When suitable, connect the course material to real-world applications, making it more interesting and relevant for the students.  Encourage small group discussions to promote active participation and cultivate collaborative learning dynamics.  Integrate polls and other interactive activities, such as think-pair-share exercises, to sustain students’ involvement and attentiveness throughout the section.

Above all, remember to be approachable and attentive to your students’ needs.  Regularly assess their understanding of the material by posing thoughtful questions, and if possible, engage in one-on-one check-ins.  Demonstrating genuine care for their learning journey and offering support will establish a positive learning atmosphere.  Ultimately, these practices will foster a more enriching and rewarding educational experience for everyone involved.  By adopting these engagement strategies and maintaining a supportive learning environment, you can empower students to thrive in their academic journey.

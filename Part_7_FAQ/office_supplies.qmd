# Office Supplies

## Canvas

You will not be expected to purchase office supplies that directly relate to your teaching duties; e.g. chalk, whiteboard markers, etc. Rather, the department provides supplies like these to graduate students in the so-called "Supply Drawer", located in the PSTAT Main Office (SH 5607). Please note that the office is always locked outside of business hours and also on days when the Staff are remote, so please plan accordingly.

# Office Hours

Typically, TAs are expected to hold one hour of weekly Office Hours per Section led. This means that TAs appointed at 25% time usually host one (1) hour of Office Hours per week, and TAs appointed at 50% time usually host two (2) Office Hours per week. 

The Office Hour is a time when students in your discussion section can come and ask you questions about the class. This typically involves questions about the assignments. Though you are allowed to hold office hours in your cubicle/office space, you also have the option of using the following <a href="https://booked.pstat.ucsb.edu/Web/index.php?redirect=%2FWeb%2Fdashboard.php%3F" target="_blank">portal</a>) to reserve one of the following classrooms:

# Grading {#Grading}

Certain Instructors expect TAs to aid in the grading of assignments and assessments. It is typical for TAs to grade assessments that take place during Sections they lead (e.g., quizzes, worksheets, labs, etc.). As a TA, you may also be asked to grade homework assignments should the Instructor deem it necessary. It is also typical for TAs to grade exams (midterms and finals) under the guidance of the Instructor. 

Some Instructors grade using online tools (e.g.,  Gradescope, Canvas), whereas others prefer to grade on paper and in person. If your Instructor decides on in-person/synchronous grading, they (or the Head TA) will likely coordinate blocks of time for grading sessions during which you will be asked to come to campus and grade exams. Again, though, the workload asked of you should never exceed the maxima outlined in the section on Workload Expectations above. Please communicate with the Instructor and/or Head TA if you feel your grading obligations will extend your workload beyond a reasonable amount.

It is your responsibility as a TA to ensure you complete the grading of assignments and assessments by the deadlines set by the Instructor (deadlines that will often be discussed with and agreed upon by all members of the Course Staff). It is not fair to students to have to wait extended periods of time before receiving feedback on their work. Additionally, please let the Instructor know if you have any major assessments for your own classes or qualifying exams coming up that may interfere with the typical timing of grading assessments.

    "text": "Certain Instructors expect TAs to aid in the grading of assignments and assessments. It is typical for TAs to be in charge of grading exams (midterms and finals), and it is also typical for TAs to be in charge of grading assessments that take place during Sections they lead (e.g. quizzes, worksheets, labs, etc.). As a TA, you may also be asked to aid in the grading of homework assignments should the Instructor deem it necessary.\nSome Instructors grade electronically (over Gradescope, Canvas, etc.), whereas others prefer to grade in-person and on paper. If your Instructor decides to grade in-person/on-paper, they (or the Head TA) will likely coordinate a series of several-hours-long sessions during which you will be asked to come to campus and grade exams. Again, though, the workload asked of you should never exceed the maxima outlined in the section on Workload Expectations above. Please communicate with the Instructor and/or Head TA if you feel your grading obligations will extend your workload beyond a reasonable amount.\nIt is your responsibility as a TA to ensure you complete the grading of assignments and assessments by the deadlines set by the Instructor (deadlines that will often be discussed with and agreed upon by all members of the Course Staff). It is not fair to students to have to wait extended periods of time before receiving feedback on their work.\nFurthermore, you will most likely be asked to aid in the grading of Final Exams. This will necessitate you to make yourself available for a handful of grading sessions either during Final Exam week, or the week after, to be scheduled by the Instructor and/or Head TA. The Instructor will coordinate with all TAs at the start of the quarter to find a time that works for everyone- you then must attend the grading sessions at the agreed-upon times."

    "text": "During the Summer before the new academic year begins, the department will send the annual Teaching Assistant Application. Graduate students who would like to be considered for a teaching assistant position must complete this form.\nPlease be as detailed as possible, especially for the following sections.\n\nWorkload Expectations It is common for graduate students to work at 50% full time employment (FTE) which equates to 20 hours per week as well as two sections of a course. It is important for the Department to know your availability per quarter as section assignments are made. For example, if you anticipate having a Graduate Student Research position and would like to split your time between that appointment and the teaching assistant position, the department can make adjustments to your TA course assignments.\nPrior TA Experience If you have been a teaching assistant for the PSTAT department in the past, you may list your experience here. You can list which courses in the department you have previously taught.\nTA/Reader Assignment Preferences This section will allow you to pick which courses you would like to be assigned to teach. While first choice classes may not be guaranteed, the department tries to accommodate as many preferences as possible.\nOther skills and qualifications Students may list other qualifications that may be helpful when assigning TAs to courses. Additional information such as proficiency in software packages, previous graduate degrees, passed actuarial exams would be important to note here.\n\nThe information from the teaching assistant application will be used by the Director of Graduate Studies to assign graduate students to courses for the entire academic year. You should receive information about the courses that you will be assigned at the beginning of the year. Assignments to the specific sections of their courses and finalization of the schedule will occur at the start of each quarter. You should receive this information from the Student Affairs Manager."

These are online surveys where students answer questions about the course on a scale of 1 to 5, and the students also are given the opportunity to make comments. The system is available in the last weeks of the quarter for students to complete the survey. Discuss with your instructor whether they want you to give reminders to your students or set aside time in section for students to complete the ESCI forms.\nAfter the quarter has ended, you will receive the results of the ESCI’s. Thinking carefully about the feedback is an important tool for improving your teaching. Try not to worry too much about a single negative comment, but instead try to use all of the results to understand how your students experienced the course and your teaching. Consider changes that you could make to your approach in section to address the concerns of students. It may be useful to discuss the ESCI responses with your instructor or Head TA if you are not sure what the feedback means."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Fostering active student engagement in section is vital for effective learning. Before the course commences, it is crucial to clarify the instructor’s expectations for the sections. Depending on the course, some may follow a highly structured approach, providing a designated timeline and activities for each section, while others may grant more autonomy to the TA. Regardless of the level of flexibility, there are various strategies that can be effectively utilized to enhance student engagement.\nWhile numerous engagement strategies are available, we will focus on a few of our favorites. To begin your first section on a positive note, employ fun and interactive icebreaker activities that foster a welcoming and collaborative learning environment. When suitable, connect the course material to real-world applications, making it more interesting and relevant for the students. Encourage small group discussions to promote active participation and cultivate collaborative learning dynamics. Integrate polls and other interactive activities, such as think-pair-share exercises, to sustain students’ involvement and attentiveness throughout the section.\nAbove all, remember to be approachable and attentive to your students’ needs. Regularly assess their understanding of the material by posing thoughtful questions, and if possible, engage in one-on-one check-ins. Demonstrating genuine care for their learning journey and offering support will establish a positive learning atmosphere. Ultimately, these practices will foster a more enriching and rewarding educational experience for everyone involved. By adopting these engagement strategies and maintaining a supportive learning environment, you can empower students to thrive in their academic journey."

# Distressed Students

The University provides a number of different resources including [Distressed Student Response Protocols](https://studentsindistress.sa.ucsb.edu/distressed-students-response-protocol). It is a good idea to review this material at the start of the quarter so that you know what is available if a difficult situation arises.

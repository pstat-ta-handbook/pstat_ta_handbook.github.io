    "section": "",
    "text": "Teaching Assistants are generally hired at either 50% or 25% time. A 50% TA is responsible for two discussion sections, and a 25% TA is responsible for one discussion section. The expectation is that the workload is about 10 hours per week for each discussion section that you are responsible for. However, not every week is the same, and some weeks will be busier than others.\nThere are Union Rules which stipulate that TAs hired at 50% time may not be assigned work exceeding 220 hours per quarter (110 for 25% positions). Furthermore, no one can be asked to work for more than 40 hours in any given week or more than 8 hours in a given day. Additional rules and specific details are provided in Section 32 of the amended UAW 2865 contract.\nWhat this typically means is that you will not be asked to work in excess of 20 hours per week on a regular basis for your TA duties (10 hours if you are a 25% TA). These 20 (10) hours include time spent:\n\nPreparing for Sections\nLeading Sections\nHosting Office Hours\nAttending lectures (if you are asked to do so)\nAnswering student and/or Instructor emails\nGrading\nTaking attendance\nReviewing course material and/or assessments (if applicable)\n\nIf you feel the workload being asked of you is in danger of approaching or exceeding the above-stated limits, you are encouraged to reach out to the Instructor to discuss adjusting your workload. Should discussions with the Instructor prove unsuccessful, you are encouraged to reach out to either the Graduate Student Advisor or the Lead TA to discuss further.\nPlease note: you are expected to prepare for each of the sections and Office Hours (OH) you lead. Above all, this entails working through any provided material (e.g. worksheets, homework, etc.) fully before coming into your section/OH, and ensuring you are able to answer questions about the material without having to reference the solutions. That is, you should not prepare by just skimming over the solutions provided to you- make sure you can solve all problems on your own, and that you are able to answer student questions adequately. It is unfair to your students if you come to Sections or Office Hours underprepared, especially if you are simply “reading from the solutions” and not providing any additional insight.\nAs a TA the notion of “business hours” can become a bit complicated, especially if you are leading a section late in the evening (be warned that some sections for courses meet from 7 - 7:50pm). It is important for your own mental health to set boundaries with regards to the times of day during which you will be working on your TA duties, and the times during which you will not. As always, the amount of work you spend on your TA duties should not exceed the maxima outlined above.\nYou will typically not be asked to work on weekends or holidays (though, depending on your own schedule, you may find it prudent to plan/prepare for sections over the weekend, especially if you are holding a section on Monday). Course Staff Meetings should also not be scheduled on weekends or holidays except in extreme or emergency circumstances. One exception is the initial meeting Instructors hold with their TAs- these meetings almost always occur either during break or during the weekend right before the start of the quarter. You should make every effort to be available for this meeting, just as the Instructor will make every effort to be respectful of your time and keep the meeting from running too long.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCommunication is key!"

Please note, however, that certain Instructors may ask you to hold additional office hours, with the understanding that your duties in other areas of the course will be lessened.\nThe Office Hour is a time when students in your Discussion Section can come and ask you questions about the class. Please check with your Instructor if you are allowed to discuss assignments/assessments during Office Hours; additionally, under no circumstances should you be sharing solutions with students, or even letting students see solutions that have been provided to you.\nThough you are allowed to hold office hours in your cubicle/office space, you also have the option of using the following portal to reserve one of the following classrooms:\n\nSouth Hall 5421 (commonly referred to as the “StatLab:)\nBuilding 434 Room 113\nBuilding 434 Room 126"

It is typical for TAs to be in charge of grading exams (midterms and finals), and it is also typical for TAs to be in charge of grading assessments that take place during Sections they lead (e.g. quizzes, worksheets, labs, etc.). As a TA, you may also be asked to aid in the grading of homework assignments should the Instructor deem it necessary.\nSome Instructors grade electronically (over Gradescope, Canvas, etc.), whereas others prefer to grade in-person and on paper. If your Instructor decides to grade in-person/on-paper, they (or the Head TA) will likely coordinate a series of several-hours-long sessions during which you will be asked to come to campus and grade exams. Again, though, the workload asked of you should never exceed the maxima outlined in the section on Workload Expectations above. Please communicate with the Instructor and/or Head TA if you feel your grading obligations will extend your workload beyond a reasonable amount.\nIt is your responsibility as a TA to ensure you complete the grading of assignments and assessments by the deadlines set by the Instructor (deadlines that will often be discussed with and agreed upon by all members of the Course Staff). It is not fair to students to have to wait extended periods of time before receiving feedback on their work.\nFurthermore, you will most likely be asked to aid in the grading of Final Exams. This will necessitate you to make yourself available for a handful of grading sessions either during Final Exam week, or the week after, to be scheduled by the Instructor and/or Head TA. The Instructor will coordinate with all TAs at the start of the quarter to find a time that works for everyone- you then must attend the grading sessions at the agreed-upon times."

It is important for the Department to know your availability per quarter as section assignments are made. For example, if you anticipate having a Graduate Student Research position and would like to split your time between that appointment and the teaching assistant position, the department can make adjustments to your TA course assignments.\nPrior TA Experience If you have been a teaching assistant for the PSTAT department in the past, you may list your experience here. You can list which courses in the department you have previously taught.\nTA/Reader Assignment Preferences This section will allow you to pick which courses you would like to be assigned to teach. While first choice classes may not be guaranteed, the department tries to accommodate as many preferences as possible.\nOther skills and qualifications Students may list other qualifications that may be helpful when assigning TAs to courses. Additional information such as proficiency in software packages, previous graduate degrees, passed actuarial exams would be important to note here.\n\nThe information from the teaching assistant application will be used by the Director of Graduate Studies to assign graduate students to courses for the entire academic year. You should receive information about the courses that you will be assigned at the beginning of the year. Assignments to the specific sections of their courses and finalization of the schedule will occur at the start of each quarter. You should receive this information from the Student Affairs Manager."

Thinking carefully about the feedback is an important tool for improving your teaching. Try not to worry too much about a single negative comment, but instead try to use all of the results to understand how your students experienced the course and your teaching.

    "text": "Fostering active student engagement in section is vital for effective learning. Before the course commences, it is crucial to clarify the instructor’s expectations for the sections. Depending on the course, some may follow a highly structured approach, providing a designated timeline and activities for each section, while others may grant more autonomy to the TA. Regardless of the level of flexibility, there are various strategies that can be effectively utilized to enhance student engagement.\nWhile numerous engagement strategies are available, we will focus on a few of our favorites. To begin your first section on a positive note, employ fun and interactive icebreaker activities that foster a welcoming and collaborative learning environment. When suitable, connect the course material to real-world applications, making it more interesting and relevant for the students. Encourage small group discussions to promote active participation and cultivate collaborative learning dynamics. Integrate polls and other interactive activities, such as think-pair-share exercises, to sustain students’ involvement and attentiveness throughout the section.\nAbove all, remember to be approachable and attentive to your students’ needs. Regularly assess their understanding of the material by posing thoughtful questions, and if possible, engage in one-on-one check-ins. Demonstrating genuine care for their learning journey and offering support will establish a positive learning atmosphere. Ultimately, these practices will foster a more enriching and rewarding educational experience for everyone involved. By adopting these engagement strategies and maintaining a supportive learning environment, you can empower students to thrive in their academic journey."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Effective time management and stress management are crucial skills for Teaching Assistants to navigate their roles successfully. As a TA you will juggle multiple responsibilities – including leading sections, grading assignments, collaborating with instructors, and answering emails – in addition to taking your own classes. Adopting strategies to manage your time efficiently is therefore essential.\nOne key aspect of effective time management is setting clear priorities. This is accomplished by identifying the most critical tasks and allocating time accordingly. Prioritizing tasks based on deadlines, urgency, and importance allows you to stay organized and focused. Utilizing tools like to-do lists or time management apps can aid in keeping track of tasks and deadlines.\nAnother effective time management strategy is creating a structured schedule. You can designate specific time blocks for various responsibilities, such as preparing for sections, grading, and emails. This structured approach helps minimize distractions and ensures that each task receives adequate attention. Finally, you can enhance time management by learning to delegate when possible. Collaborating with other TAs or seeking guidance from instructors can help distribute the workload, fostering a more balanced and efficient environment.\nTo effectively deal with stress, you should practice self-care and maintain a healthy work-life balance. Engaging in activities that you enjoy, whether it is hobbies, exercise, or spending time with friends, can provide a much-needed respite from work-related pressures. Additionally, mindfulness practices, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises, can help you manage stress in the moment. Taking short breaks during intense periods can also prevent burnout and allow you to return to your tasks with renewed focus.\nSeeking support from colleagues and supervisors is vital when facing stress or challenges. Having a support network to share experiences and seek advice can provide valuable insights and encouragement. Most importantly, it’s essential for you to be realistic about your capabilities and to know when to ask for help. Acknowledging limitations and seeking assistance when needed can prevent you from becoming overwhelmed and ensure that you can perform your duties effectively."

On the one hand, many Instructors are your colleagues- you will be taking their classes as students, and you may even be conducting research with some of them on a one-on-one basis. However, while you are performing your duties as a TA for their class, they are still technically your “boss” or “supervisor” and should be treated with the respect that such a title commands.\nThe number one piece of advice we can give you is to maintain communication- we encourage you to maintain an active dialogue with your Instructor (be that through the course Discussion Board [Nectir, Discord, Slack, etc.] or through regular TA-Instructor check-ins) about your workload, as well as any unexpected issues that may arise.\nAnother guiding tenet of the TA-Instructor relationship is maintaining a sense of professionalism and cohesion among the course staff. You should not publicly challenge decisions made by Instructors or your fellow TAs in front of your students- doing so degrades students’ trust in the Course Staff as a whole, which often leads to an overall sense of disarray in the course. Rather, you should handle as many of these disagreements in private (again, on Course Staff-specific Discussion Boards or meetings) as possible.\nFinally, we would also like to affirm that the department is here to support you. If repeated efforts to resolve conflicts with your Instructor have been unsuccessful, please feel free to reach out to either the Graduate Advisor or Lead TA (Chapter 3) to discuss further."

In such a situation, you should start by reaching out to the other TAs in the course for which you are a TA, to see if any of them are able to cover for you. If that proves unsuccessful, you should reach out to the Instructor to discuss. Do NOT simply call a friend to substitute for you without receiving prior approval from the Instructor.\nYou should also not simply make one of your Sections remote (i.e., over Zoom) without first contacting the Instructor (unless your course has a PSTATW designation; e.g., PSTATW 120A, PSTATW 160A, etc., as PSTATW-courses are designed for majority-remote instruction). The university has set policies in place limiting the amount of remote instruction that may legally be conducted, and this includes limiting the number of sections that can be conducted remotely.\nPlease note that if you fail to lead any of your assigned sections, or unexpectedly cancel/make a section remote without prior Instructor approval, your TA appointment may be terminated after review by the department.

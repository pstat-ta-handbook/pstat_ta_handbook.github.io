## Canvas

Currently, UCSB utilizes **Canvas** (<a href="canvas.ucsb.edu" target="_blank">canvas.ucsb.edu</a>) as the primary learning management system on which most course sites are built. **LSIT** (Letters and Sciences IT) offers several resources for students and instructors that are new to the Canvas learning system at <a href = "https://help.lsit.ucsb.edu/hc/en-us/categories/5360081368475-Canvas" target="_blank">https://help.lsit.ucsb.edu/hc/en-us/categories/5360081368475-Canvas</a>; additionally, you can submit a "help ticket" for one-on-one (virtual) help using the following link: <a href="https://help.lsit.ucsb.edu/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=1260809796629 " target="_blank">https://help.lsit.ucsb.edu/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=1260809796629 </a>

## Gradescope

Many instructors also utilize **Gradescope** to aid in the uploading, management, and grading of student assessments. You can log into gradescope by navigating to <a href="http://gradescope.com/" target="_blank">http://gradescope.com/</a> and logging in with your UCSB credentials- please note that your `@umail.ucsb.edu` address and your `@ucsb.edu` address will have separate Gradescope accounts unless you physically merge them; we encourage you to merge these accounts as soon as possible to avoid any future confusion when logging in to specific Gradescope course sites. You can find information on how to merge your Gradescope accounts at <a href="http://gradescope.com/" target="_blank">https://help.gradescope.com/article/ipjyg27lg5-student-merge-accounts.</a>

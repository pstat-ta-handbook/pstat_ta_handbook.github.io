# Expectations for ULAs

Undergraduate Learning Assistants (ULAs) play a valuable role within the teaching team, offering additional support to enhance students' academic success in the course.  ULAs are equipped to provide numerous forms of assistance, including but not limited to, assisting in discussions or lab activities, conducting tutoring sessions for small groups, holding office hours, hosting review sessions, and facilitating study groups. The PSTAT Department offers dedicated tutoring space that can be conveniently scheduled by ULAs.

It is important to note that while ULAs are well-qualified to provide various forms of support, certain responsibilities are restricted to other instructional staff members, such as faculty, Teaching Associates, or Teaching Assistants. ULAs are not authorized to lead discussion or lab sections, assign grades to student work, or independently handle activities designated to the aforementioned personnel.

ULAs are hired as hourly employees and assigned a fixed number of weekly hours.  They are not required to work during finals week. If there is a need for any modifications to their allocated hours, ULAs must promptly communicate such requests in advance to both the department and the instructor.  Moreover, ULAs are responsible for tracking their worked hours, as this information will be required for their time card.

    "text": "Certain Instructors expect TAs to aid in the grading of assignments and assessments. It is typical for TAs to be in charge of grading exams (midterms and finals), and it is also typical for TAs to be in charge of grading assessments that take place during Sections they lead (e.g. quizzes, worksheets, labs, etc.). As a TA, you may also be asked to aid in the grading of homework assignments should the Instructor deem it necessary.\nSome Instructors grade electronically (over Gradescope, Canvas, etc.), whereas others prefer to grade in-person and on paper. If your Instructor decides to grade in-person/on-paper, they (or the Head TA) will likely coordinate a series of several-hours-long sessions during which you will be asked to come to campus and grade exams. Again, though, the workload asked of you should never exceed the maxima outlined in the section on Workload Expectations above. Please communicate with the Instructor and/or Head TA if you feel your grading obligations will extend your workload beyond a reasonable amount.\nIt is your responsibility as a TA to ensure you complete the grading of assignments and assessments by the deadlines set by the Instructor (deadlines that will often be discussed with and agreed upon by all members of the Course Staff). It is not fair to students to have to wait extended periods of time before receiving feedback on their work.\nFurthermore, you will most likely be asked to aid in the grading of Final Exams. This will necessitate you to make yourself available for a handful of grading sessions either during Final Exam week, or the week after, to be scheduled by the Instructor and/or Head TA. The Instructor will coordinate with all TAs at the start of the quarter to find a time that works for everyone- you then must attend the grading sessions at the agreed-upon times."

It is important for the Department to know your availability per quarter as section assignments are made. For example, if you anticipate having a Graduate Student Research position and would like to split your time between that appointment and the teaching assistant position, the department can make adjustments to your TA course assignments.\nPrior TA Experience If you have been a teaching assistant for the PSTAT department in the past, you may list your experience here. You can list which courses in the department you have previously taught.\nTA/Reader Assignment Preferences This section will allow you to pick which courses you would like to be assigned to teach. While first choice classes may not be guaranteed, the department tries to accommodate as many preferences as possible.\nOther skills and qualifications Students may list other qualifications that may be helpful when assigning TAs to courses. Additional information such as proficiency in software packages, previous graduate degrees, passed actuarial exams would be important to note here.\n\nThe information from the teaching assistant application will be used by the Director of Graduate Studies to assign graduate students to courses for the entire academic year. You should receive information about the courses that you will be assigned at the beginning of the year. Assignments to the specific sections of their courses and finalization of the schedule will occur at the start of each quarter. You should receive this information from the Student Affairs Manager."

The system is available in the last weeks of the quarter for students to complete the survey. Discuss with your instructor whether they want you to give reminders to your students or set aside time in section for students to complete the ESCI forms.\nAfter the quarter has ended, you will receive the results of the ESCI’s. Thinking carefully about the feedback is an important tool for improving your teaching. Try not to worry too much about a single negative comment, but instead try to use all of the results to understand how your students experienced the course and your teaching. Consider changes that you could make to your approach in section to address the concerns of students. It may be useful to discuss the ESCI responses with your instructor or Head TA if you are not sure what the feedback means."

    "text": "Fostering active student engagement in section is vital for effective learning. Before the course commences, it is crucial to clarify the instructor’s expectations for the sections. Depending on the course, some may follow a highly structured approach, providing a designated timeline and activities for each section, while others may grant more autonomy to the TA. Regardless of the level of flexibility, there are various strategies that can be effectively utilized to enhance student engagement.\nWhile numerous engagement strategies are available, we will focus on a few of our favorites. To begin your first section on a positive note, employ fun and interactive icebreaker activities that foster a welcoming and collaborative learning environment. When suitable, connect the course material to real-world applications, making it more interesting and relevant for the students. Encourage small group discussions to promote active participation and cultivate collaborative learning dynamics. Integrate polls and other interactive activities, such as think-pair-share exercises, to sustain students’ involvement and attentiveness throughout the section.\nAbove all, remember to be approachable and attentive to your students’ needs. Regularly assess their understanding of the material by posing thoughtful questions, and if possible, engage in one-on-one check-ins. Demonstrating genuine care for their learning journey and offering support will establish a positive learning atmosphere. Ultimately, these practices will foster a more enriching and rewarding educational experience for everyone involved. By adopting these engagement strategies and maintaining a supportive learning environment, you can empower students to thrive in their academic journey."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Effective time management and stress management are crucial skills for Teaching Assistants to navigate their roles successfully. As a TA you will juggle multiple responsibilities – including leading sections, grading assignments, collaborating with instructors, and answering emails – in addition to taking your own classes. Adopting strategies to manage your time efficiently is therefore essential.\nOne key aspect of effective time management is setting clear priorities. This is accomplished by identifying the most critical tasks and allocating time accordingly. Prioritizing tasks based on deadlines, urgency, and importance allows you to stay organized and focused. Utilizing tools like to-do lists or time management apps can aid in keeping track of tasks and deadlines.\nAnother effective time management strategy is creating a structured schedule. You can designate specific time blocks for various responsibilities, such as preparing for sections, grading, and emails. This structured approach helps minimize distractions and ensures that each task receives adequate attention. Finally, you can enhance time management by learning to delegate when possible. Collaborating with other TAs or seeking guidance from instructors can help distribute the workload, fostering a more balanced and efficient environment.\nTo effectively deal with stress, you should practice self-care and maintain a healthy work-life balance. Engaging in activities that you enjoy, whether it is hobbies, exercise, or spending time with friends, can provide a much-needed respite from work-related pressures. Additionally, mindfulness practices, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises, can help you manage stress in the moment. Taking short breaks during intense periods can also prevent burnout and allow you to return to your tasks with renewed focus.\nSeeking support from colleagues and supervisors is vital when facing stress or challenges. Having a support network to share experiences and seek advice can provide valuable insights and encouragement. Most importantly, it’s essential for you to be realistic about your capabilities and to know when to ask for help. Acknowledging limitations and seeking assistance when needed can prevent you from becoming overwhelmed and ensure that you can perform your duties effectively."

    "section": "18.2 Conflicts with Instructors",
    "text": "18.2 Conflicts with Instructors\nNavigating the relationship between a TA and their Instructor can be a bit delicate. On the one hand, many Instructors are your colleagues- you will be taking their classes as students, and you may even be conducting research with some of them on a one-on-one basis. However, while you are performing your duties as a TA for their class, they are still technically your “boss” or “supervisor” and should be treated with the respect that such a title commands.\nThe number one piece of advice we can give you is to maintain communication- we encourage you to maintain an active dialogue with your Instructor (be that through the course Discussion Board [Nectir, Discord, Slack, etc.] or through regular TA-Instructor check-ins) about your workload, as well as any unexpected issues that may arise.\nAnother guiding tenet of the TA-Instructor relationship is maintaining a sense of professionalism and cohesion among the course staff. You should not publicly challenge decisions made by Instructors or your fellow TAs in front of your students- doing so degrades students’ trust in the Course Staff as a whole, which often leads to an overall sense of disarray in the course. Rather, you should handle as many of these disagreements in private (again, on Course Staff-specific Discussion Boards or meetings) as possible.\nFinally, we would also like to affirm that the department is here to support you. If repeated efforts to resolve conflicts with your Instructor have been unsuccessful, please feel free to reach out to either the Graduate Advisor or Lead TA (Chapter 3) to discuss further."

It is expected that all TAs will be present for all Sections they are assigned throughout the quarter, unless explicitly instructed otherwise by the Instructor.\nInform the Instructor of the course as soon as you know that you have a planned absence (i.e., if you know in advance that you will be unable to host sections on a particular set of day(s)) during the quarter. In such a situation, you should start by reaching out to the other TAs in the course for which you are a TA, to see if any of them are able to cover for you. If that proves unsuccessful, you should reach out to the Instructor to discuss. Do NOT simply call a friend to substitute for you without receiving prior approval from the Instructor.\nYou should also not simply make one of your Sections remote (i.e., over Zoom) without first contacting the Instructor (unless your course has a PSTATW designation; e.g., PSTATW 120A, PSTATW 160A, etc., as PSTATW-courses are designed for majority-remote instruction). The university has set policies in place limiting the amount of remote instruction that may legally be conducted, and this includes limiting the number of sections that can be conducted remotely.\nPlease note that if you fail to lead any of your assigned sections, or unexpectedly cancel/make a section remote without prior Instructor approval, your TA appointment may be terminated after review by the department. It is the responsibility of all TAs to ensure students are receiving proper attention and instruction."

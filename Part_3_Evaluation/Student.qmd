# Student Evaluations

At the end of each quarter, the students will give feedback about your section via the [Evaluation System for Courses and Instruction](https://id.ucsb.edu/teaching/course-evaluations/for-instructors) (ESCI). These are online surveys where students answer questions about the course on a scale of 1 to 5, and the students also are given the opportunity to make comments. The system is available in the last weeks of the quarter for students to complete the survey. Discuss with your instructor whether they want you to give reminders to your students or set aside time in section for students to complete the ESCI forms.

After the quarter has ended, you will receive the results of the ESCIâ€™s. Thinking carefully about the feedback is an important tool for improving your teaching. Try not to worry too much about a single negative comment, but instead try to use all of the results to understand how your students experienced the course and your teaching. Consider changes that you could make to your approach in section to address the concerns of students. It may be useful to discuss the ESCI responses with your instructor or Head TA if you are not sure what the feedback means.

    "text": "The Mission of the Department of Statistics and Applied Probability is, in part, to provide education and training to UCSB students in the areas of statistics, data science, actuarial science, financial mathematics, and applied probability. We seek to educate and prepare the future workforce of data scientists and quantitative thinkers.\nOur graduate students are given the opportunity to work as Teaching Assistants, Graders/Readers, and Teaching Associates in order to help further these educational goals. Our TAs work together with faculty, instructors, and colleagues to provide a broader reach to our teaching, to give additional perspective and context to classroom material, and to interact more closely with students. A Teaching Assistant position is also a key part of graduate student training in that it brings greater understanding of the key material in statistics and applied probability as well as preparing the next generation of teachers.\nOur graduate students come from diverse backgrounds that strengthen our department as a whole. As stated in the PSTAT Department Mission Statement,\n\nIncreasing diversity across our field is essential in creating more productive, representative, and enriching outcomes as well as innovative solutions to critical problems. We recognize that, historically, the job markets and academic communities in statistical theory and methods, financial mathematics, and actuarial science have been weighted toward racial, gender, and socioeconomically privileged communities. We are dedicated to correcting this imbalance in our own community.\n\nTo this end, Teaching Assistants are encouraged to bring their own unique personal history and perspective to their role in ways that contribute to educating our students. They should also reach out across categories and intersectionalities to support every student who comes to our classes."

Before the start of the quarter, the Instructor will reach out to you and convey additional information about the course as well as their expectations of you as a TA. This often takes the form of an introductory meeting between the Instructor and all TAs of the course (as well as the Head TA, if applicable), though certain instructors prefer to communicate this initial set of expectations through email instead of a meeting. Regardless of the mode of communication, the Instructor will make sure you are aware of your duties in the course."

In particular, you should make every effort to respond to Instructor emails within one or two business days of when they are sent. Similarly, Instructors will make every effort to respond to your emails within the same time period (one-to-two business days).\nPlease note that, in certain extraordinary circumstances, you may be asked to respond to emails over the weekend (e.g., if the final exam for the course for which you are a TA falls on a Saturday). This will not, however, be a regular expectation of you.\nIn certain cases, it may be necessary/beneficial to adopt a second mode of communication between TAs and Instructors. This can take the form of a Nectir Chat, Slack Channel, Discord Server, Google Chat Room, etc. If your Instructor chooses to establish such a resource, you should also ensure that you are checking it regularly and that, again, communications are not being left unanswered for extended periods of time."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Teaching Assistants are generally hired at either 50% or 25% time. A 50% TA is responsible for two discussion sections, and a 25% TA is responsible for one discussion section. The expectation is that the workload is about 10 hours per week for each discussion section that you are responsible for. However, not every week is the same, and some weeks will be busier than others.\nThere are Union Rules (see Glossary) which stipulate that TAs hired at 50% time may not be assigned work exceeding 220 hours per quarter (110 for 25% positions). Furthermore, no one can be asked to work for more than 40 hours in any given week or more than 8 hours in a given day. Additional rules and specific details are provided in Section 32 of the amended UAW 2865 contract.\nWhat this typically means is that you will not be asked to work in excess of 20 hours per week on a regular basis for your TA duties (10 hours if you are a 25% TA). These 20 (10) hours include time spent:\n\nPreparing for Sections\nLeading Sections\nHosting Office Hours\nAttending lectures (if you are asked to do so)\nAnswering student and/or Instructor emails\nGrading\nTaking attendance\nReviewing course material and/or assessments (if applicable)\n\nIf you feel that the workload being asked of you is in danger of approaching or exceeding the above-stated limits, you are encouraged to reach out to the Instructor to discuss adjusting your workload. Should discussions with the Instructor prove to be unsuccessful, you are encouraged to reach out to either the Teaching Assistant Training Coordinators or the Lead TA.\nPlease note: you are expected to prepare for each of the sections and Office Hours (OH) you lead. Above all, this entails working through any provided material (e.g., worksheets, homework, etc.) fully before coming into your section/OH, and ensuring that you are able to answer questions about the material without having to reference the solutions. That is, you should not prepare by just skimming over the solutions provided to you–make sure you can solve all problems on your own, and that you are able to answer student questions adequately. It is unfair to your students if you come to Sections or Office Hours underprepared, especially if you are simply “reading from the solutions” and not providing any additional insight.\nAs a TA, the notion of “business hours” can become a bit complicated, especially if you are leading a section late in the evening (be aware that some sections for courses meet from 7 - 7:50pm). It is important for your own mental health to set boundaries with regards to the times of day during which you will be working on your TA duties, and the times during which you will not. As always, the amount of work you spend on your TA duties should not exceed the maxima outlined above.\nYou will typically not be asked to work on weekends or holidays (though, depending on your own schedule, you may find it prudent to plan/prepare for sections over the weekend, especially if you are holding a section on Monday). Course staff meetings should also not be scheduled on weekends or holidays except in extreme or emergency circumstances. One exception is the initial meeting Instructors hold with their TAs–these meetings almost always occur either during break or during the weekend right before the start of the quarter. You should make every effort to be available for this meeting, just as the Instructor will make every effort to be respectful of your time and keep the meeting from running too long.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCommunication is key!"

A typical section will consist of a review portion (in which you review lecture material for your students) along with some time for students to work through a worksheet or lab activity. Certain sections, however, are led like an Office Hour and are more flexible in structure. If you are unclear about how you are expected to lead sections, please reach out to the Instructor.\nNote: Please refrain from going through questions on the homework assignments prior to the due dates unless the Instructor has indicated that this is okay."

It is typical for TAs to grade assessments that take place during Sections they lead (e.g., quizzes, worksheets, labs, etc.). As a TA, you may also be asked to grade homework assignments should the Instructor deem it necessary. It is also typical for TAs to grade exams (midterms and finals) under the guidance of the Instructor.\nSome Instructors grade using online tools (e.g., Gradescope, Canvas), whereas others prefer to grade on paper and in person. If your Instructor decides on in-person/synchronous grading, they (or the Head TA) will likely coordinate blocks of time for grading sessions during which you will be asked to come to campus and grade exams. Again, though, the workload asked of you should never exceed the maxima outlined in the section on Workload Expectations above. Please communicate with the Instructor and/or Head TA if you feel your grading obligations will extend your workload beyond a reasonable amount.\nIt is your responsibility as a TA to ensure you complete the grading of assignments and assessments by the deadlines set by the Instructor (deadlines that will often be discussed with and agreed upon by all members of the Course Staff). It is not fair to students to have to wait extended periods of time before receiving feedback on their work.

However, as a TA, you may be asked to aid in the creation or modification of certain course materials.\nMore specifically, you may be asked to oversee the creation of materials for assessments that take place during your Section Time (e.g., weekly quizzes). The creation of such material, however, is designed to be more akin to “versioning”, and will likely entail simply adapting pre-existing course materials (e.g., homework problems, textbook exercises, etc.) by changing a few words and numbers. You may, additionally, be expected to create the solutions to these assessments. The rationale behind this expectation is that you will likely be responsible for the administration and proctoring – and possibly even the grading of – these assessments; as such, your involvement in every stage of their development is paramount.\nSo, as a general rule of thumb: you may be asked to contribute to or create assessments (and their solutions) that will take place during Section. All other course material should be created by the Instructor. As always, if you foresee any difficulties in or concerns with carrying out these duties, please communicate with the Instructor, Head TA, or department (by way of either the Lead TA, the Teaching Assistant Training Coordinators, or the Graduate Program Advisor)."

    "text": "As part of your TA duties, you may be expected to proctor exams during the quarter. Please note that even as a TA employed at 25% time you may still be asked to proctor all exams for the course; the expectation is that the Instructor will modify your workload in other capacities correspondingly to ensure your workload is consistent with your official appointment.\nIt is the responsibility of the Instructor to provide additional information if needed regarding what specific duties are entailed in the proctoring of an exam. For in-person exams, most instructors expect proctors to maintain a vigilant eye on the students in the room, and to report any suspicious behavior to the Instructor or Head TA (if applicable) as soon as possible. Additional proctoring duties may include: distribution and collection of exams, answering of student questions during the duration of the exam, providing a headcount of students present in the exam room, etc.\nVigilance during exam proctoring is key. While proctoring, you should not be continually on your phone, working on your own projects, or talking with other proctors. Not only is this sort of behavior counterproductive, it can also disrupt students while they are taking their exams. Rather, keep an active eye on students and follow any instructions given to you by your Instructor and/or Head TA carefully.\nIf timed assessments/quizzes take place during Section times, you will likely be responsible for the proctoring of these assessments. You may also be expected to aid in the creation of Section-specific assessments, as outlined in the previous section of this Handbook (Creation of Course Materials)."

Questions regarding specific student circumstances or general course logistics should in many cases be directed to the Head TA, who may decide to include the Instructor on future communications. Furthermore, weekly/regular TA meetings may be led exclusively by the Head TA in certain circumstances, though the Instructor is still expected to maintain a heavy presence in the administration of the course.\nA Head TA position comes with extra responsibility, and so it is generally offered only to more senior, experienced Teaching Assistants who are familiar with the workings and logistics of that particular course. Head TAs are selected from recommendations by the instructors and the TA training team. The compensation for taking on this leadership role is a reduction in the number of sections that you will be asked to lead. If you are interested in becoming a Head TA in a future quarter, please talk to your Instructor or the DGS."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Graders (or “Readers” which is their official job title) are hired to grade student work. Typically, graders are given weekly homework papers to grade. Most often the course instructor will provide solutions to the assigned questions as well as a rubric describing how points are to be assigned in the grading. It is your responsibility to make sure that you understand the intentions of your instructor both as to what answers are considered acceptable and also how points should be distributed for partially correct answers. (See Grading)\nTime Cards Unlike Teaching Assistant positions, Grader (Reader) positions are hired as hourly employees. This means that you are responsible for keeping track of the number of hours you spend each week grading papers. These hours should include any time that you spend working on solutions or understanding the material in preparation for grading.\nAt the end of each pay period, Graders will need to submit a time card via the university system. Readers will be required to report their worked hours into the Kronos Timekeeping system. Graders are on a biweekly pay period, and should receive reminders from the Kronos system to log hours and approve each timecard.\nGraders work with their course Instructor to be sure that they are grading the appropriate number of hours. It is crucial that the total number of hours worked matches the amount budgeted at the end of the quarter. It is also important to note that Graders are eligible to receive tuition remission if they have at least 100 hours reported in Kronos by the end of the quarter.\nFor example, If you were told that you were assigned two courses for grading 65 hours for one and 35 hours for the other, at the end of the quarter it is okay if you have worked 55 hours and 45 hours, but the total number of hours needs to be 100. You should also coordinate with the instructors of both of those courses so that they understand how you are using your time.\nWork together with your Instructor to schedule when you have grading to do. It is often the case that there is more grading to be done in later weeks of the quarter than at the beginning. This is to be expected. You can mitigate the effects on your schedule by finishing your grading work in a timely manner. You do not want your unfinished work to build up as more homework comes in each week. Let your instructor know if there are weeks when you will be particularly busy so that they can try to schedule the grading appropriately. Especially during finals week, you will want to plan ahead and know how much work you will be expected to do. Leave enough space in your schedule to complete the grading on time. In the rare case that something comes up such that you do not think you will be able to complete your grading in time, make sure to communicate with the Instructor as far in advance as possible."

Before the course commences, it is crucial to clarify both the Instructor’s and your expectations for the sections. Depending on the course, some may follow a highly structured approach, providing a designated timeline and activities for each section, while others may grant more autonomy to the TA. Regardless of the level of flexibility, there are various strategies that can be effectively utilized to enhance student engagement.\nWhile numerous engagement strategies are available, we will focus on a few of our favorites. To begin your first section on a positive note, employ fun and interactive icebreaker activities that foster a welcoming and collaborative learning environment. You can find some ideas for icebreakers here. As you go throughout the quarter, connect the course material to real-world applications when suitable, making it more interesting and relevant for the students. Encourage small group discussions to promote active participation and cultivate collaborative learning dynamics. Integrate polls and other interactive activities, such as think-pair-share exercises, to sustain students’ involvement and attentiveness throughout the section.\nAbove all, remember to be approachable and attentive to your students’ needs. Regularly assess their understanding of the material by posing thoughtful questions, and if possible, engage in one-on-one check-ins. Demonstrating genuine care for their learning journey and offering support will establish a positive learning atmosphere. Ultimately, these practices will foster a more enriching and rewarding educational experience for everyone involved. By adopting these engagement strategies and maintaining a supportive learning environment, you can empower students to thrive in their academic journey.\nPlease find below additional resources that can help:\n\nhttps://id.ucsb.edu/teaching/teaching-resources/engaging-students/overview\nhttps://id.ucsb.edu/teaching/teaching-resources/ta-programs/pillars-of-teaching-assistantship\nhttps://id.ucsb.edu/teaching/ta-training/video-consultation"

    "text": "20.1 Classroom Issues\nThe classroom is meant to be a place where student learning and understanding is fostered and promoted. On rare occasions, you may have a student who disrupts the learning environment with their behavior or comments. If a student exhibits disruptive behavior in the classroom, try to remain calm and ask the student to refrain from the disruptive behavior or commenting. According to the UCSB Office of Student Conduct, after notifying the student of questionable, offending, disruptive conduct and giving them the opportunity to respond and/or the opportunity to correct the behavior, an instructor may exclude from class, either temporarily or permanently, any student whose conduct is disruptive toward the instructor or other members of the class. If you need to dismiss a student from the classroom, let the Instructor know as soon as possible so that appropriate actions (e.g., formal reporting) can be taken."

A well-crafted syllabus acts as a contract between the student and the instructor which details expectations and policies. Having this agreement ensures that everyone in the course is treated fairly. The syllabus also ensures consistency across Sections in a course. Be sure to follow the policies in the syllabus for the course, bringing any questions to the Instructor. Please note that policies exist for fairness across all students in the course and that you should not make changes without consultation with the Instructor."

    "text": "21.2 Grading on Individual Assignments\nThe majority of issues that students raise will be regarding the way that their assignments are graded. TAs will typically be the first contact forthat a student who goes to first when they sees something amiss in the way their work was graded. Your job is to react respectfully and carefully. It may be as straightforward as helping the student see how their work was not correct or did not meet expectations.\nHowever, if you recognize that you have made a mistake in your grading of some work, then you can honestly acknowledge the mistake and make whatever correction to the grading record is necessary. Even when we are being very careful, mistakes and misunderstandings do happen. We can try to not be defensive and react like we would hope your instructors would react with you in a similar situation. If it is a mistake that you think was made consistently across many students’ work, then you should talk with your instructor about how to remediate the error.\nIf it appears that there was an error made in the grading done by one of your colleagues or the instructor, then you should bring this to the attention of the instructor. It is important that the grading corrections be addressed in a coordinated and consistent fashion.\nAdditionally, make sure to follow any grading rubric that is provided to you by the instructor so that all students’ assignments are graded consistently. Should you have questions (e.g., partial credit), be sure to ask the instructor so that a decision can be made for the course as a whole. This is especially important when grading in Gradescope–any changes that you make to the rubric for your students propagates to all students in the course, including students with other TAs. No changes should be made to a grading rubric prior to consultation with the instructor.\nFor exam grading, instructors may have specific policies about the timing and decisions about grading questions. Often, students will be required to bring up grading issues on exams right away so that there isn’t any question about alterations made to papers. Talk to your Head TA or instructor so that you know what the class policy is. Do not make any changes to a student’s exam grade without having clear permission from the course instructor."

It is entirely appropriate for you to advocate on behalf of your students. However, at the end of the day, the instructor is depending on you to be a part of a team. The instructor needs to be able to make decisions for the whole class and have those policies carried out consistently across sections.\nEven if you do not agree with a course policy (see Conflicts with Instructors), it is imperative that you do not criticize the course or instructor to the students. This is very harmful to the educational objectives of the course, and it will not, in the end, serve the course or your students. If you find you are not able to defend a course policy, then you need to communicate that with the instructor. They will be able to address the issues with students."

The instructor will want to make the decisions regarding a complex or troublesome issue from a student. It is often helpful if you let the student know the best way to bring up the issue with the instructor (e.g., email, office hours, Canvas).\nIf a student is angry or hostile, then directing them to the instructor can de-escalate the situation. Acknowledge the student’s concerns and redirect them to the authority of the instructor. If you are feeling unsafe, removing yourself from that situation is your first priority. You have no obligation to confront the student. You can call 911 on campus to reach campus police."

    "text": "In your role as a TA, you will be working with the instructor and other TAs towards the shared goal of educating the students in the course in a supportive learning environment. Being a TA might be the first time you have interacted with a faculty member as part of an instructional team. Occasionally, you might find that navigating the relationship between a TA and their Instructor can be a bit delicate. On the one hand, instructors are your colleagues – you will be taking their classes as students, and you may even be conducting research with some of them on a one-on-one basis. On the other hand, the Instructor ultimately is in charge of the course as a whole and has the final word. Occasionally, this can help you out–if a student doesn’t agree with a policy, you can “pass the buck” to the instructor!\nThe number one piece of advice we can give you is to maintain communication – we encourage you to maintain an active dialogue with your Instructor (be that through the course Discussion Board [Nectir, Discord, Slack, etc.] or through regular TA-Instructor check-ins) about your workload, as well as any unexpected issues that may arise.\nAnother guiding tenet of the TA-Instructor relationship is maintaining a sense of professionalism and cohesion among the course staff. You should not publicly challenge decisions made by Instructors or your fellow TAs in front of your students – doing so degrades students’ trust in the course staff as a whole and possibly in the Instructor, which often leads to an overall sense of disarray in the course. It is important to provide the students with a “united front” as an instructional team and handle as many of these disagreements in private with the Instructor and instructional team.\nFinally, we would also like to affirm that the department is here to support you. If repeated efforts to resolve conflicts with your Instructor have been unsuccessful, please feel free to reach out to the Graduate Program Advisor, the Graduate Studies Chair, the TA Training Coordinators, or the Lead TA to discuss further.\n\n\n\n\n%%{\n  init: {\n    'theme': 'base',\n    'themeVariables': {\n      'primaryColor': '#BB2528',\n      'primaryTextColor': '#fff',\n      'primaryBorderColor': '#7C0000',\n      'secondaryColor': 'red',\n      'tertiaryColor': '#fff',\n      'edgeLabelBackground': 'red'\n    }\n  }\n}%%\n\nflowchart TD\n    linkStyle default stroke: black;\n    \n    AA[Student] --&gt;|Concerns about the Course|A(Teaching Assistant)\n    A --&gt;|Course Content and Policy Issues|B(Course Instructor)\n    B --&gt; C(TA Training Coordinator)\n    B --&gt; D(Lead TA)\n    A --&gt;|Teaching Questions|D\n    C & D --&gt; E(DGS) \n    E --&gt; F(Department Chair)\n    AA & A & D --&gt; G(Ombuds Office)"

In such a situation, you should start by reaching out to the other TAs in the course for which you are a TA, to see if any of them are able to cover for you. If that proves unsuccessful, you should reach out to the Instructor to discuss. Do NOT simply call a friend to substitute for you or cancel section without receiving prior approval from the Instructor.\nYou should also not simply make one of your Sections remote (i.e., over Zoom) without the Instructor’s prior approval (unless your course has a PSTATW designation; e.g., PSTATW 120A, PSTATW 160A, etc., as PSTATW-courses are designed for majority-remote instruction). The university has set policies in place limiting the amount of remote instruction that may legally be conducted, and this includes limiting the number of sections that can be conducted remotely.\nPlease note that if you fail to lead any of your assigned sections, or unexpectedly cancel/make a section remote without prior Instructor approval, your TA appointment may be terminated after review by the department.

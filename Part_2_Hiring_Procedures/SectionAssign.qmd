# Section Assignments

Once course assignments are completed, the [Student Affairs Manager (SAM)](#Staff) will assign TAs to sections of their course. Instructors and all teaching assistants will have the schedules communicated to them by the SAM via email before the quarter starts.

## Schedule Conflicts

If TAs have a time conflict with their assigned section, it is recommended to try to switch sections with another TA in that same course, if possible. After checking with all other TAs for the course (and the Head TA for the course, if applicable) then the next step would be to communicate with the DGS to be switched into a different course.

## Confirming Section Assignments

If ther3e are no conflicts with your assigned section, please confirm with the SAM that your assign9ment is finalized. This will trigger the SAM and [Undergraduate Program Advisors (UPA)](#Staff) to assign you to the section in GOLD and [eGrades](http://egrades.sa.ucsb.edu), which will grant you access to the course website in Canvas. In addition, your end-of-the-quarter teaching evaluations will be assigned based on what is listed in eGrades.
